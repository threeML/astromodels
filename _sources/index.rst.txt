About astromodels
-----------------

.. image:: media/large_logo.png


Astromodels is a very flexible framework to define models for likelihood or
Bayesian analysis of astrophysical data.

Even though it has been designed having in mind analysis in the spectral domain,
it can be used also as a toolbox containing functions of any variable.

Astromodels is *not* a modeling package, it only gives you the tools to build a
model as complex as you need.  You then need a separate package (such as
`3ML <https://github.com/threeML/threeML>`) to fit that model to the data.

Some of the features which distinguish astromodels from other similar packages
are:

* a model can contain an arbitrary number of sources at different positions in
  the sky
* parameters can be linked through any function (not only identity)
* parameters can vary with *auxiliary variables* such as time. For example, you
  can build a model where some parameters vary with time, and you can fit the
  parameters of the function which describe this variability.  Similary you can
  build models where parameters vary with the phase of a pulsar, and so on.
* models can be saved in and loaded from YAML file (a human-readable format)
* physical units are fully supported in input, but they are handled so that they
  don't slow down the actual computation of the models.

Astromodels has been designed with performance as priority, and is considerably
faster than other python-based solutions for the same problem, such as
astropy.modeling and the modeling part of sherpa.

.. warning:: Note for XSPEC users

    Starting from version 2.5.0 there is currently support for XSPEC 12.15.0
    installed via Conda via the `xspec` conda package (see
    `here <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/conda.html>`_).
    
    If you compiled XSPEC from source, please set the environment variable
    ASTRO_XSPEC_VERSION to the version of XSPEC you are using, in the build
    process and make sure to have the HEADAS environment variable set.

    XSPEC versions lower than 12.12.0 or greater than 12.15.0 are not supported.

    Support for `xspec-modelsonly` conda package has been discontinued.
    Please use the conda package `xspec==12.15.0` instead.
